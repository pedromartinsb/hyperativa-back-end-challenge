# ADR 0003: Use Spring Security with OAuth2

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to implement secure authentication and authorization for the Visa Credit Card API. The requirements include:

- Secure user authentication
- Token-based authorization
- Protection against common security vulnerabilities
- Integration with existing OAuth2 providers

## Decision

We will use Spring Security with OAuth2 Resource Server for authentication and authorization, including:

- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting with Bucket4j
- CORS configuration
- Security headers

## Consequences

### Positive

- Industry-standard security implementation
- Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities
- Easy integration with OAuth2 providers
- Comprehensive security features
- Well-documented and maintained

### Negative

- Additional configuration required
- Need to manage token lifecycle
- May require additional infrastructure for token management
- Team needs to understand OAuth2 concepts
- May add complexity to development environment setup
